# Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

- e.g. student_heights = `[180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]`

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

- e.g.
`180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146`

There are a total of `7 heights in student_heights`

`1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572`

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = `164`

Important You should not use the `sum()` or `len()` functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

## Example Input

`156 178 165 171 187`
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: `[156, 178, 165, 171, 187]`

## Example Output

`171`

## Hint

Remember to use the `round()` function to round the average height before you print it.

# Exercise 2

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. `student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

Important you are not allowed to use the `max` or `min` functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

### Example Input

`78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89`
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: `[78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

### Example Output

The highest score in the class is: 91
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

## Hint

Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?
