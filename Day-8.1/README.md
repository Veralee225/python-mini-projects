## Caesar Cipher

### Part 1 - Encryption

- Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.

- Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.

- Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.

### Part 2 - Decryption

- Create a different function called 'decrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.

- Inside the 'decrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' *backwards* in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the decrypted text. 

- Check if the user wanted to encrypt or decrypt the message by checking the 'direction' variable. Then call the correct function based on that 'drection' variable. You should be able
