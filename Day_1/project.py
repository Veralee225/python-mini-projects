# mini project: create a band name generator

print("Welcome to the band generator!")

# Assign the city name using the input() function and also adding a new line
city_name = input("What is the name of your city?\n")

# doing the same for pet name
pet_name = input("What is your pet's name?\n")

# print the final result. This result is concatenated
print("Your band name is " + city_name + "" + pet_name)
