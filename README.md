### Tip Calculator

#### Instructions

- If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

- Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

- Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

- Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

- Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.üí™

#### Example Input

- Welcome to the tip calculator!
- What was the total bill? $124.56
- How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
- How many people to split the bill? 7

#### Example Output

- Each person should pay: $19.93

#### Hint

- How to round a number to 2 decimal places in Python
- How to limit a float to two decimal places in Python
